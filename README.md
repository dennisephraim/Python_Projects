# Python Projects
Welcome to my collection of Python projects! This repository features various Python programs, 
primarily focused on games I've built over the years. Each project demonstrates different aspects of 
Python programming, from simple games to more advanced implementations.

## Projects
Tic-Tac-Toe
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where a player competes against a computer that never loses. The best possible outcome for the human player is a draw.

Snake Game
A retro snake game implemented using Python and the pygame library. Control the snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls or its own tail.

Hangman
A console-based word guessing game where the player has a limited number of guesses to reveal the hidden word.

Number Guessing Game
A simple game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.

More projects will be added over time as I continue building and improving them.
